# exploitation
```
using the exploit called:
auxilary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login

for getting the password and the username
and after the username and password I got I used the 

sessions -i 1 
this command opened a reverse shell or ssh shell for me where I can use it for furhter exploitation

or you can also ssh into the machine 

ssh msfadmin@192.168.1.16

and then enter the passwd as msfadmin and u will ssh that machine.

DONE!!!!!
